## First-WebGPU-App

This [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app) demonstrates how to simulate Conway's Game of Life using WebGPU, a modern graphics and compute API for the web. I built a high-performance, real-time version of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, leveraging the power of GPU compute shaders to efficiently handle the simulation logic.
